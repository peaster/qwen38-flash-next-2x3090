# Qwen3.8 Flash Next on dual RTX 3090, RTX 4090, and RTX 5090: hardware guide

## Tested hardware contract

The released serving profile was validated on one Linux x86_64 host with:

| Resource | Validated configuration |
|---|---|
| GPUs | 2× NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB each |
| System memory | 128 GB |
| Swap | At least 32 GiB on fast NVMe; 48–64 GiB recommended |
| Runtime | Docker with NVIDIA Container Toolkit |
| Workload | One model instance, one request, up to 262,144 total tokens |

This is the compatibility target recorded in
[`repro.lock.json`](../repro.lock.json). Hardware outside that target can be a
useful experiment, but this repository does not claim that it will start, fit,
or match the published performance.

### September 5 benchmark host

The new public probes record more detail than the original hardware summary:

| Component | Observed configuration |
|---|---|
| CPU | AMD Threadripper PRO 5975WX, 32 cores / 64 threads |
| RAM | 8×16 GB DDR4-3200, eight populated memory channels |
| GPUs | 2× RTX 3090; 300 W power limit per card |
| PCIe | Gen 4 ×16 on both cards under load; PHB topology, no NVLink |
| Kernel / driver | Linux 7.0.0-30-generic / NVIDIA 595.84 |
| CUDA P2P | Read/write topology checks and PyTorch peer capability passed in both directions |
| Runtime boundary | Isolated clean vendor vLLM + the 27-file public overlay, using existing native dependencies; not a fresh Docker build |

These details describe this host, not a minimum CPU specification or a promise
that every stock 3090 driver provides P2P. The public Docker quickstart remains
the supported reproduction path. The native experiment records its environment
and overrides separately from the original release.

The measured candidate used an 84-expert hot cache, custom all-reduce enabled,
and `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False`. It completed three
exact-count `repo-chat` requests of 258,048 input + 4,096 output at a 75.636
tok/s reciprocal-mean aggregate. Four recoverable allocator warnings appeared
during the first long prefill, with no stream failures. The current Docker
defaults use an 84-expert cache, custom all-reduce disabled, and expandable
segments enabled. This is not the same profile as that earlier candidate.
See the [September 5 benchmark bundle](../benchmarks/2026-09-05/README.md)
and [machine-readable summary](../benchmarks/2026-09-05/summary.json).

All 27 model weight files on this host matched the published SHA-256 manifest
for canonical tensor revision `ef554143369a706525336f6b42a09094835dc077`.

## Why this fits when the standard vLLM checkpoint does not

The [official vLLM recipe](https://recipes.vllm.ai/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)
lists 172.78 GiB for the stock FP8 checkpoint and 335.28 GiB for BF16. Its
PLE-only CPU offload and larger-GPU deployments use different checkpoint
formats and memory placement. Those estimates do not describe this runtime.

This is a custom checkpoint and runtime combination. The assembled target is
116.183 GiB of Intel AutoRound W4A16 weights and FP8 PLE, plus a separate
3.855 GiB compact MTP draft. The checked-in overlay keeps PLE and the complete
routed-expert pool in system memory while caching hot experts on the GPUs.
The original BF16 or FP8 checkpoint and stock vLLM flags are different memory
configurations; they do not reproduce this setup. See the exact
[checkpoint formats and runtime pins](../repro.lock.json).

## Why 48 GB of VRAM is not one 48 GB GPU

The two 3090s provide 48 GB in aggregate, but CUDA still exposes two separate
24 GB address spaces. Tensor parallelism splits one model instance across both
cards; it does not pool them into a general-purpose 48 GB allocation. The
released profile also creates a BF16 KV allocation of about 4.13 GiB on each
GPU and keeps 84 hot experts per layer on GPU.

An allocation that must fit on one rank is still limited by that rank's free
VRAM. Both cards therefore need adequate headroom. One card cannot substitute
for the validated pair merely because system RAM can hold offloaded tensors.
See [Memory sizing and OOM recovery](memory.md) for the separate VRAM, RAM, and
swap budgets.

## Is NVLink required?

No. The topology used for the historical release results did not provide usable
CUDA peer access, yet it produced those results. The default launcher passes
`--disable-custom-all-reduce` and uses the selected TP2/EP2 collective path.
The September 5 PHB host also had no NVLink, but CUDA P2P worked in both
directions; the native candidate therefore enabled custom all-reduce with
expandable segments disabled and completed the full model probes. Neither
profile required NVLink.

Do not use a slot label or advertised PCIe width as proof that CUDA peer access
works. Motherboard routing, IOMMU configuration, and the GPU/driver topology can
change the usable path. The published numbers describe the tested topology,
not every two-slot system.

PCIe still matters. Cold routed experts remain in host-backed memory, and data
must cross the host/GPU boundary when the hot cache misses. Poor link placement
or contention can reduce decode throughput even though NVLink is unnecessary.

### Check CUDA peer access on your own host

Host diagnostics:

```bash
nvidia-smi topo -p2p r
nvidia-smi topo -p2p w
```

After building the image, check what CUDA exposes to PyTorch:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --entrypoint python \
  qwen38-flash-next-2x3090:locked -c \
  'import torch; print(torch.cuda.can_device_access_peer(0, 1), torch.cuda.can_device_access_peer(1, 0))'
```

Both directions must work before trying `DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE=0` in `.env`.
The pinned custom path additionally needs an IPC-compatible allocator; its
CUDA graph registration fails with the default expandable-segment allocator.
That flag controls vLLM's custom collective, not driver-level peer access.
See the [allocator settings and test protocol](performance.md#cuda-p2p-and-custom-all-reduce).

## A third GPU for the PLE table

A GPU that is not one of the two TP cards can hold the PLE n-gram table instead of host RAM:
`QWEN38_PLE_GPU=GPU-<uuid>` in [`configs/ple-gpu.env`](../configs/ple-gpu.env) binds the PLE offload process
to it, keeps as many 381 MiB shards as fit in its memory (38 of 128 on a 16 GB card) and reads the rest from
pinned host memory through UVA. CUDA peer access to the TP cards is not needed; the table's consumer is a
host process. Speed does not change; on the October 3 test host (2× RTX 3090 at PCIe 4.0 ×8 plus an RTX
5060 Ti 16 GB on a chipset PCIe 3.0 ×4 slot) it freed about 13 GiB of RAM, which the
[prefill profile](../configs/fast-256k-prefill.env) spends on 8,192-token chunks. Pass the card to the
container with `GPU_DEVICES` (a CDI spec generated before the card was installed does not list it under
`all`). Results and limits: [`benchmarks/2026-10-03/`](../benchmarks/2026-10-03/README.md).

## Why system memory bandwidth matters

This runtime intentionally uses the host as an active memory tier:

- a dedicated CPU process owns the large FP8 PLE/ngram table;
- the complete routed-expert pool remains addressable in pinned host memory;
- only the current hot expert set is resident on the GPUs.

PLE lookups and cold-expert accesses are on the token path. CPU memory latency,
memory-channel population, NUMA placement, and sustained host bandwidth can
therefore affect decode. Fast NVMe swap helps the model survive peak loading,
but active paging during generation is a performance failure. Watch `vmstat 1`;
persistent swap-in or swap-out means the run is no longer comparable with the
published measurements.

## Can I run Qwen3.8 Flash Next on dual RTX 4090?

Two RTX 4090 cards have not been validated by this project. Their 24 GB per-card
capacity does not by itself prove compatibility with the pinned kernels,
container, collectives, topology, or full-context memory budget. No 4090
throughput number or support promise should be inferred from the 3090 results.

If testing 4090s, start with the unchanged released profile, retain the pinned
checkpoint and image, run the full preflight, and treat the result as new
hardware evidence. A successful short prompt is not enough to claim 262K
support; the boundary test is 262,016 input tokens plus 128 output tokens.

## Community report: dual RTX 5090

A contributor ran the checkpoint on two RTX 5090s and reported **105.7 tok/s
for narrative and 114.3 tok/s for code**. The setup and measurements below come
from [hardware report #7](https://github.com/DominikBucko/qwen38-flash-next-2x3090/issues/7).
We have not reproduced them on 5090s.

| Component | Reported configuration |
|---|---|
| GPUs | 2× RTX 5090, 32 GB each; compute capability 12.0 |
| CPU | Threadripper PRO 3975WX, 32 cores / 64 threads, one NUMA node |
| RAM | 251 GiB visible; no active swapping during serving |
| PCIe | Gen 4 ×16 on both cards, PHB topology, no NVLink |
| OS / driver | Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS / NVIDIA 610.57.04 |

The contributor built the normal Docker overlay from repository commit
[`ceaa9fa`](https://github.com/DominikBucko/qwen38-flash-next-2x3090/tree/ceaa9fae4f02669bdb9ca81953e797529b451b75).
The pinned base image worked without an extra rebuild for compute capability
12.0. The run used the published checkpoint at revision
`ef554143369a706525336f6b42a09094835dc077`, TP2/EP2, Humming, UVA expert
offload, approximate QSA, and compact INT4 MTP3.

### Settings and results

The only override at that commit was `CPU_OFFLOAD_GB=22`, down from 30.
The key effective settings were:

```dotenv
CPU_OFFLOAD_GB=22
VLLM_WNA16_STATIC_HOT_CACHE_SIZE=88
MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144
MAX_NUM_SEQS=1
MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=4096
KV_CACHE_MEMORY_BYTES=4429185024
MTP_DEPTH=3
DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE=1
```

This report predates the change to hot84. The current 3090 profile still uses
hot84 and `CPU_OFFLOAD_GB=30`; the 5090 settings above are not new defaults for
3090s or 128 GB RAM hosts.

| Natural-prompt measurement | Reported result |
|---|---:|
| Narrative decode | 105.7 tok/s |
| Code decode | 114.3 tok/s |
| Short-chat time to first token | 357 ms |

These are medians of five streaming runs after three warmups, with one request
at a time. Sampling used temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, and min-p 0.
Decode excluded time to first token. The report does not give token counts for
these natural prompts, so these are **not established 256K decode rates** or a
matched comparison with our 3090 benchmarks.

The server was configured for 262,144 total tokens. The listed near-full test
used 257,625 input + 4,096 output = 261,721 tokens, with `CPU_OFFLOAD_GB=30`.
That is close to the limit, but not an exact boundary test. Its repeated filler
also gave near-perfect MTP acceptance, so we do not use its decode rate as a
representative result.

### What helped on that host

- Reducing `CPU_OFFLOAD_GB` from 30 to 22 improved reported natural-prompt
  decode by 12–17% and prefill by 25%. The report does not give an absolute
  natural-prompt prefill rate.
- MTP3 beat MTP2; reducing draft depth cost 4.5% on narrative decode.
- Raising the prefill batch from 4,096 to 8,192 did not help. Raising the hot
  cache above 88 caused an OOM during KV allocation.

Peak VRAM was 29.3 and 30.4 GiB. More VRAM did not remove the need to budget
for the hot cache, KV cache, and working memory. Start with the pinned runtime,
check [memory use](memory.md), and measure each change on your own workload.
The report does not establish how much of the gain depends on its larger RAM
capacity, and it does not test image inputs or concurrent requests.

## Host and container responsibilities

The host supplies Linux x86_64, the NVIDIA driver, Docker, the NVIDIA Container
Toolkit, physical RAM, swap, and access to both GPUs. `make preflight` checks
the operating system, architecture, Docker daemon, visible GPU count, host
memory, swap, and the PLE IPC-related ptrace setting.

The image supplies the pinned user-space runtime. Its
[`Dockerfile`](../docker/Dockerfile) starts from a digest-pinned Qwen3.8 vLLM
image, installs `humming-kernels==0.1.12`, applies the checksummed vLLM overlay,
and copies the released configuration and hot-cache rankings. Installing a
different host CUDA toolkit does not replace those container components.

The checkpoint stays outside the image and is mounted read-only at `/model`.
The host NVIDIA driver must be compatible with the container's CUDA user-space
stack, but this repository does not declare an unverified minimum driver
version. Keep the pinned image boundary intact when reproducing results.

## Text-only serving is the default

By default, the launcher passes `--language-model-only`. The throughput
benchmarks in this guide cover text requests through the OpenAI-compatible
endpoint. An [opt-in image profile](vision.md) has passed basic image and
text-context capacity checks on two 3090s. It has not been tested on 5090s.
Audio and video inputs are not validated.

## Setup FAQ

### What should I run before the first launch?

Set `MODEL_DIR` to the downloaded checkpoint, configure NVMe-backed swap, then
run:

```bash
make preflight
make serve
```

The checkpoint must include its compact MTP model under
`runtime/mtp-int4-g32`. The complete setup is in the [README](../README.md),
and immutable source/runtime pins are in the
[reproduction guide](reproduce.md).

### Can I use one 3090?

The checked-in launcher requires two visible CUDA GPUs and hard-codes tensor
parallel size 2. A single-GPU configuration is unsupported and was not tested.

### Can I use 64 GB of system RAM?

No supported 64 GB profile is provided. The tested minimum is 128 GB plus swap.
Swap is load-time headroom, not a substitute for enough resident memory during
serving.

### Why does startup look stuck?

The CPU PLE worker loads a large part of the checkpoint and registers shared
buffers. The released readiness timeout is 1,200 seconds. Check logs, resident
memory, and disk activity before assuming a deadlock.

### What should I change after an OOM?

First identify the memory pool. A kernel OOM while loading points to host RAM or
swap; a `torch.OutOfMemoryError` points to VRAM. For VRAM, check that an older
`.env` is not still selecting hot88. Start with the current hot84 default;
try hot80 if more headroom is needed. If necessary, reduce the explicit KV allocation to
4,294,967,296 bytes and confirm the startup log still reports the context
capacity you need. The exact order and tradeoffs are in
[Memory sizing and OOM recovery](memory.md).
