# Field notes for agents

Read this before changing the checkpoint, serving flags, scheduler, or benchmark
scripts. The README is for users. This file records the engineering logic that
is easy to lose when looking only at the final configuration.

## Ground truth

The validated target is one Qwen3.8-Flash-Next request spread across two RTX
3090 24 GB cards, backed by 128 GB of system memory. The two GPUs do not each
hold an independent 256K context. Tensor parallelism splits one model instance
and one 262,144-token sequence across both cards.

The published checkpoint is:

```text
albucino/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-W4A16-FP8PLE
canonical tensor revision: ef554143369a706525336f6b42a09094835dc077
```

`repro.lock.json` is authoritative for upstream revisions, the container digest,
tensor counts, and runtime versions. Do not replace a full revision or digest
with `main`, `latest`, or a floating image tag.

When a verified result changes, update the machine-readable benchmark JSON, the
generated graph, this file, and any public claim in the same commit. Do not let
an old explanation survive after its underlying flag or workload changes.

Keep the September 5 candidate measurements separate from the historical
release and hillclimb shapes:

| Candidate claim | Request shape and run policy | Result |
|---|---|---:|
| Near-full-context chat | `repo-chat`, 258,048 input + 4,096 output, 3 measured, no explicit warmup | 75.636 API-observed output tok/s, reciprocal-mean TPOT |
| Short chat | `repo-chat`, 128 input + 4,096 output, 1 warmup + 3 measured | 77.2845 API-observed output tok/s, reciprocal-mean TPOT |

The long per-run rates were 74.030749, 76.707158, and 76.224624 tok/s;
TTFT was 215.128, 211.059, and 211.228 seconds. The short run range was
74.7459–79.7072 tok/s. The candidate used hot-cache 84, bidirectional CUDA P2P,
custom all-reduce enabled, and expandable segments disabled. The current default
is 84/disabled/True. The September 5 candidate remains a different profile.

Historical benchmark shapes:

| Claim | Request shape | Result |
|---|---:|---:|
| Peak prefill | 65,536 input tokens | 1,402 prompt tok/s |
| Balanced full-context prefill | 262,016 input + 128 output | 1,275.583 prompt tok/s |
| Full-context boundary probe | 262,016 input + 128 output | 54.485 output tok/s |
| Matched short-decode endpoint | 128 input + 256 output, 10 requests | 80.08 output tok/s |
| Peak warmed long decode | 128 input + 4,096 output, one request | 135.21 output tok/s |

The 1,402 prefill and 135.21 decode figures are not from the same request. The
80.08 and 135.21 decode figures are not directly comparable either. The longer
decode amortizes one-time request overhead and gives MTP much more time to pay
for itself. Preserve this distinction in every chart, report, and regression
test.

All 27 weight files used by the September 5 probes matched the published
SHA-256 manifest for canonical tensor revision
`ef554143369a706525336f6b42a09094835dc077`. The native boundary was a clean
pinned vendor vLLM plus the public overlay using existing dependencies, not a
fresh Docker build.

## September 18 performance publication

`benchmarks/2026-09-18/summary.json` and its README report experimental screens,
not a runtime release. The public overlay, launch defaults, lock and canonical
checkpoint tensors are unchanged. Do not infer that cloning main enables the
new measurements. Experimental image digests are audit IDs, not pullable images.

The latest candidate completed 131,072+2,048 in 75.899 s to first token at
89.113 output tok/s, and 260,096+2,048 in 139.821 s at 86.206 output tok/s.
Input/TTFT rates are 1,726.935 and 1,860.207 tok/s. They include scheduling and
first-token work. The earlier full-context screen took 214.487 s: a 34.8%
observed wait reduction, not an isolated causal gain. Preceding cache state
differs and each point is one request. Preserve this qualification near claims.
The September 18 README and HF headline paired the best input/TTFT rate (1,860
at 260,096 input) with the best decode rate (89.1 after 131,072 input) from
separate requests. Since September 25 the headline is one release-image request
(131,072+2,048: 2,752 input tok/s, 104.5 decode); keep its shape and the
full-context result immediately below the headline.

The most useful engineering change was the large-prefill expert view: hot GPU
pages plus an immutable host suffix under one contiguous logical tensor. Keep
small-query LRU behavior separate. The earlier 128K screen went from 100.741 to
72.910 s, but preceding synthetic/short-chat warmups differed. Later startup
warmup covered actual ten-expert routing shapes; three-query QSA reused a
four-row padded specialization. A boundary tail pause shrank from 4.286 to
0.121 s, but that pair had worse total request time. Do not call the warmup
free: startup and host prefault costs are outside request timing.

The latest experiment overlaps down-weight staging with gate/up compute for a
bounded four-query path. Changing-route integration checked 140 cases per GPU
in batch-invariant diagnostic mode. It does not validate distributed or full
model quality. There is no matched overlap-OFF full-model result. The candidate
fresh-agent run was stopped before completion; do not invent a score for it.

The completed fresh-agent smoke belongs to the preceding tiered+warmup image:
13 requests, 58,191 new tokens / 39.379 s = 1,477.722 new-prefill tok/s, 79.430
decode tok/s, 174,400/232,591 cached prompt tokens (74.98%). One DBG-06 task
passed, not the full suite. Frozen-history replay reached 85.276 tok/s on the
latest candidate; it is latency evidence only. Greedy output varied in controls
and candidates. Quality parity and adoption require further matched tests and
at least three fresh trajectories per configuration.

Regenerate the two new SVGs with `python3 scripts/render_prefill_progress.py`.
The generator reads the published JSON. Keep original historical hillclimb
shapes intact; do not join the 135 tok/s repetitive-prompt peak to these agent
or long-context points as one matched series. Public reports must omit private
fixtures, traces, workstation names and GPU power-limit settings.

## September 25 fast 256K runtime

This release installs the runtime that was measured on September 25 as the
overlay itself; `benchmarks/2026-09-25/` records the release-image validation.
The overlay was taken from the tested image by diffing the installed vLLM
package against the wheel RECORD: 47 files, byte-identical except the new
opt-in PLE prefault in `v1/ple_offload/worker.py`. Keep that property: when a
measured runtime changes, rebuild the overlay from the image that was measured.
The September 28 Mamba state-block fix added a 48th file,
`v1/core/single_type_kv_cache_manager.py`, measured on the release image with
only that file replaced.

Always on now (all profiles): tiered prefill (one virtual expert tensor = GPU
hot rows + immutable host source rows), the exact-size pinned expert backing
(`VLLM_EXACT_PINNED_WEIGHTS=1`, C++ extension built in the Dockerfile), the
integer LRU map with startup warmup of the real ten-expert shapes, and the
specialized QSA prefill/tail kernels. These were developed and screened on the
hot84 3090 profile in the September 17-18 campaign; hot80/vision/two-client use
was only smoke-tested on the release image.

Opt-in through `configs/fast-256k.env` (copy into `.env`):

- `QWEN38_STREAM_STAGE=1`: prefill chunks of at least
  `QWEN38_STREAM_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS` tokens copy each MoE layer's cold source rows
  by DMA (copy engine) into a GPU slot one or two layers ahead and run the
  original non-cached Humming schedule from VRAM. The two slots are VMM views
  over the GPU hot pages of the last eight MoE layers; those layers stage all
  256 rows by DMA, and their hot rows are rewritten from the immutable source
  (fresh slot-id snapshot, one-time exact check) before the next step that can
  read the hot cache. No VRAM is allocated for staging. Do not replace this with
  dedicated slots: 1.26 GB/rank of slots forced hot72 and doubled decode miss
  copies. The hot set only changes in target MoE calls with <=16 tokens, so the
  snapshot is taken only after such a step (tracked in `execute_model`).
- `QWEN38_ASYNC_SCHEDULING=1`: only useful after two host-stall fixes that are
  now in the overlay. The PLE ShortConv metadata builder used pageable
  `tensor.to(device)` copies, which stream-sync before copying; they are pinned
  `async_tensor_h2d` copies now. The model thread no longer spins until the CPU
  PLE worker claims its buffer after a real step (the GPU host-copy op always
  writes ready=0 then consumed=1); the spin remains only after
  `signal_dummy_outputs`. Decode host time per step fell from 23.7 to 2.6 ms.
- `DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE=0` with `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False`:
  about 2.5 ms less per decode cycle than NCCL LL. The collective time that
  remains is mostly waiting for the rank with more expert misses.
- `QWEN38_TRITON_SKINNY=1`: all 533 unquantized linears, the LM head and the HC
  up projection use a Triton tensor-core kernel for M<=8 (M padded to 16, FP32
  accumulation, deterministic split-K). Error versus an FP32 reference matched
  cuBLAS on 78/78 shapes; isolated verify-step cost 7.9 -> 6.2 ms.
- `VLLM_MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB_RANGES=[[0,65536],[248044,248320]]`: draft-only
  restriction. Target verification is unchanged, so greedy output is unchanged.
  About 1 ms per cycle at 260K; acceptance moved within noise.
- `QWEN38_STAGE_OVERLAP=1`: the September 18 M4 down-projection copy overlap.
- `QWEN38_PLE_PREFAULT=1`: after the GPU workers register, the CPU PLE worker
  reads one byte per page of its tables in the background (stops at
  `QWEN38_PLE_PREFAULT_RESERVE_GIB`, default 4). A table that is 20% in swap
  costs about 2.4 ms per decode lookup.
- `JIT_CACHE_DIR`: persistent Humming/Triton caches. Without them the first
  long request can include kernel compiles (one 1,600-token chunk took 4.98 s
  instead of ~1.25 s) and startup is about 70 s longer.

Host RAM is the binding constraint on 128 GB: about 60.4 GB of pinned expert
sources plus the 51.2 GB PLE table leave roughly 11 GB for five processes and the
OS. On September 25 the same configuration measured 100.6 and 102.8 decode tok/s
at 260,096+2,048 on a quiet host and 91-95 tok/s while another job's download
filled the page cache and pushed the GPU workers into swap. Report host
conditions with any decode claim. Moving the input embedding to host UVA works
(`QWEN38_EMBED_UVA=1`, unadvertised) but costs 1.27 GB of host RAM; do not use it
on 128 GB hosts.

Rejected on September 25: dedicated staging slots (above); a larger KV pool to
remove async prefill stalls (the stalls were first-use JIT compiles); predictive
expert prefetch that applied each layer's router to its pre-attention input (most
predictions missed, PCIe traffic doubled, SM contention, 70 tok/s).

## September 29 agent 128K profile

`configs/agent-128k.env` is the fast 256K profile with half the context:
`MAX_MODEL_LEN=135168`, `KV_CACHE_MEMORY_BYTES=2500000000` (110 blocks) and
hot100. Decode is expert-miss bound. The miss copies and the gather were about
10 of the 29 ms in a 260K verify cycle. Spending the freed KV memory on hot
experts is therefore worth more than any kernel change measured on September 28.
Results (`benchmarks/2026-09-29/`):
- verify cycle 30.2–30.3 → 27.4 ms on the 7-prompt set (104–105 → 116.1 tok/s),
  with unchanged acceptance;
- 131K + 2K: 43.3–44.1 s to first token (2,974–3,029 tok/s), 108.5–109.8 tok/s
  decode;
- zero preemptions.

Hot sets above 96 need the widened geometry checks in `lru_warmup.py`,
`tiered_runtime.py` and `staging_runtime.py` (64–128). With the old 64–96 range,
startup stops with an "unchecked ... geometry" error. Keep the
110-block pool: 85 attention blocks, the QSA ring, and 4 Mamba groups × 6 async
prefill blocks. With 106 blocks, which vLLM reports as exactly 1.00x, a 131K
request is preempted near the end of prefill. INT8 dense weights would free
enough VRAM for hot96 at 256K. They were rejected on September 27 because the
token-agreement gate measured +0.010 nats/token (not lossless).

## September 30 64 GB RAM profile

`configs/2x3090-64gb.env` serves the same checkpoint on two RTX 3090s with 64 GB of RAM (issue #27). The 128 GB
layout cannot shrink into 64 GB by moving only the PLE table: the dynamic LRU caches need an immutable host copy
of all 512 experts per layer (~58 GiB pinned), because any cached expert can be evicted and fetched back. The
profile therefore switches to the hot-only design of the single-GPU runtime
(github.com/DominikBucko/qwen38-flash-next-3090), made expert-parallel:

- `QWEN38_HOT_ONLY=88`: each EP rank takes its hot set from the experts it owns (linear placement: rank 0 owns
  0–255), the first 88 of them in the static rankings (`fused_moe/hot_only.py`). The rankings are balanced
  across the halves (rank 0 owns 51% of the global top-200; the per-rank top-100 unions cover 97.8% of the
  global top-200). The loader skips everything else, so no expert exists twice.
- Each rank's other 168 experts per layer live once in its own anonymous, huge-page, `cudaHostRegister`'ed arena
  (`expert_store.py`, 19 GiB per rank). `vllm/qwen38_host.py` sizes it as a per-rank share of the container limit
  minus 10 GiB; at 56 GiB every cold expert fits, so the NVMe expert tier (and its tail reader) is unused.
- Decode (T <= 4): hot experts on the GPU, cold ones on a per-rank CPU pool (`cpu_experts.py`, `cpu_moe.cpp`;
  the pools are whole CCDs per rank), with `QWEN38_GPU_SHARE_FRAC` of them computed by the GPU over PCIe from the
  pinned arena (`gpu_share.py`; the selector counts only the rank's own cold experts). Each rank returns its
  partial output and the existing EP all-reduce sums them.
- Prefill: `stream_v2.py` DMAs each rank's cold experts in groups of 80, converts them to the Humming layout on
  the GPU (byte-exact to the loader) and runs the indexed GEMMs; each GPU streams only its half over its own
  PCIe link.
- The PLE table is read in place from the checkpoint files (`QWEN38_PLE_MMAP=1`, one PLE worker for both TP
  ranks, 4 intra-op threads). The warnings in "Why FP8 PLE instead of disk or INT4" apply: the benchmarks ran
  with a cold page cache per start and did not show a PLE-bound decode, but an unseen access pattern can still
  page in more rows.
- vLLM's profile run under EP routes every token to expert -1; `_mul_sum_acc_kernel` masks negative ids (without
  it the 8K dummy prefill hit an illegal memory access).

VRAM: 96 hot experts per GPU ran out of memory in the first 8K prefill chunk (105 MiB free for a 160 MiB
allocation after the 2.33 GiB KV pool); 88 peaks at 23.7 GB. The 8K chunks are the whole prefill lead over the
agent profile, not the expert layout: every chunk streams all of a GPU's cold experts once (~20 GB), and with
`MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=4096` this profile prefills 131K at 2,754 tok/s (agent profile: 2,907–2,964). The agent
profile cannot take 8K chunks as is: its 100-slot expert cache leaves no room, and with 8,192 it ran out of VRAM on
the first request (80 MiB requested, 34 MiB free). The 128 GB profiles are unchanged: every new path is
behind `QWEN38_HOT_ONLY`, `QWEN38_CPU_EXPERTS` or `QWEN38_PLE_MMAP`, and the launcher's memory limit and CPU set
are opt-in (the 128 GB loader relies on swap). Results and the regression check are in `benchmarks/2026-09-30/`.

## September 30 prefill profile

`configs/agent-128k-prefill.env` is `configs/agent-128k.env` with `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=8192` and
`VLLM_WNA16_STATIC_HOT_CACHE_SIZE=88`. Every prefill chunk streams all cold experts once (~21 GB per GPU and chunk
through the staging path), so 8K chunks halve that traffic on long prompts. hot100 cannot take them: it ran out
of VRAM on the first request (80 MiB requested, 34 MiB free). hot88 frees about 1.36 GiB per card and peaks at
23.8–24.0 GiB. Results on the published v0.5.0 image (`benchmarks/2026-09-30/`):

- The 64 GB report's benchmark, 2 runs: 131K + 512 prefill 3,884–3,912 tok/s (agent profile 2,907–2,964), 32K
  +20–23%, 8K +29%. A verify step costs 10–14% more (131K: 29.0–29.4 vs 26.2–26.6 ms); acceptance is unchanged.
- The README headline benchmark, best of 2 (same afternoon): 131K + 2K 31.27 s, 4,191 input tok/s, 101.8 tok/s
  decode; the agent profile 43.05 s, 3,045 and 111.5. The README headline therefore takes prefill from this
  profile and decode from the agent profile.
- It also out-prefills the 64 GB profile at the same chunk size (3,396). A likely cause, not measured: staging
  DMAs rows that are already in the Humming layout, while `stream_v2.py` converts them on the GPU.

The first 131K request after a start was 4.5–4.7 s slower in both profiles. The headline prompt is built from the
overlay sources, so it changed with v0.5.0: compare profiles within one day's runs, not with September 29.

## October 2 runtime abliteration

`QWEN38_ABLITERATION` (`models/qwen3_8_flash_next/nvidia/abliteration.py`, user guide in `docs/abliteration.md`)
reproduces orcarouter/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Uncensored on the published checkpoint. That release is the rank-1 edit
`W' = W − r(rᵀW)` with one direction on all 149 residual writers, so the runtime projects `r` out of those
writers' outputs instead. This is exact: requantizing edited expert down projections would add a full INT4
rounding error. Hook points and the reasons behind them:

- Decoder layer: `attn_out` (o_proj/out_proj are the last ops) and `mlp_out` (routed and shared expert outputs
  are summed with scalar weights; the 64 GB CPU and GPU-share partials too). The MTP head reuses this layer.
- PLE: right after `value_proj`. The branch then gates (a scalar per stream, linear), applies a grouped RMS norm
  and the short conv (not linear) and writes `gated + conv(norm(gated))`. Projecting the branch output would not
  match the weight edit.
- `embed_input_ids` of the target and of the MTP head. Vision embeddings are merged afterwards and stay unedited,
  as in the release. Project the lookup rather than patching `embed_tokens` in place: a patched table would also
  change every module that shares it (a tied `lm_head` when `tie_word_embeddings` is set, which the release leaves
  unedited).
- `register()` creates the buffer in the module constructors (under the default device context, so before
  CUDA-graph capture) and returns None in the CPU-only PLE worker process. `project_()` uses an in-place `addr_`
  rank-1 update, so an 8K prefill chunk needs no extra full-size buffer; the prefill profile peaks at 24.0 GiB.
- `scripts/validate_repo.py` rejects `.safetensors` files in the repo, so the direction ships as JSON
  (`configs/abliteration/orcarouter.json`), and `.dockerignore` is an allow-list that needs the directory.

The extraction (`scripts/extract_refusal_direction.py`, 83 MB of range reads from the gated release) found an
untouched control tensor byte-identical to ours. Each edit is rank-1 (σ2/σ1 < 0.01), the four tensors give the
same direction (|cos| ≥ 0.99999), and re-applying the edit reproduces the release's BF16 tensors 88–93% bit-exact,
the rest one ulp apart. Results (`benchmarks/2026-10-02/`, v0.5.0 image plus this overlay):
- agent 128K profile: 7 of 8 mild borderline requests refused with the switch off, 0 of 8 with it on;
- prefill and verify-step cost unchanged (2,909 vs 2,914 tok/s at 131K, 24.1–27.0 ms in both);
- 64 GB profile with the switch on: 0 of 8 refused, speed within 3% of its published runs.

Keep test prompts mild (`benchmarks/2026-10-02/` lists them) and do not publish replies.

## October 3 PLE table on a third GPU and the x8 prefill profile

`QWEN38_PLE_GPU=GPU-<uuid>` (`configs/ple-gpu.env`) binds the PLE offload process to a GPU that is not one of
the TP ranks. It keeps as many 381 MiB PLE shards as fit in that GPU's memory (38 of 128 on a 16 GB card,
`QWEN38_PLE_GPU_SHARDS` overrides the auto fit, `QWEN38_PLE_GPU_RESERVE_GIB` the 1 GiB reserve) and the rest
once in exact-size pinned host memory that the same GPU reads through UVA (`_PleGpuTable` in
`models/qwen3_8_flash_next/nvidia/ple_layer.py`). Both parts are contiguous row ranges, so a lookup is two
`index_select` calls; the result is copied into the existing shared host output buffers, and the TP workers,
the handshake flags and the GPU-side code are unchanged. The hash constants and pack workspaces are resolved
per device (`_hash_buffers`), so the CPU path runs the same ops as before. The worker gets the device through
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` set around `proc.start()` in `make_process`; `GPU_DEVICES` in `scripts/docker_serve.sh`
passes the third card into the container (a CDI spec generated before the card was installed lists only the
old GPUs under `all`), and the launcher checks that the UUID is visible and sets `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`
so 0,1 stay the TP pair. `QWEN38_PLE_GPU_VERIFY=n` compares the first n lookups with the checkpoint rows
through the mmap table; twelve matched, including six 2,048-token chunks (`benchmarks/2026-10-03/`).

Why that card and that table: the test host's RTX 5060 Ti has no CUDA peer access to the 3090s and sits on a
chipset PCIe 3.0 x4 slot (2.8 GB/s, 15 µs per small copy), so it cannot be a TP/EP rank, an expert tier or a KV
tier for them. The PLE lookup is the one serving-path job whose consumer is a host process and whose traffic
is tiny (64 rows per decode step, 2.5 KB per token out). It does not change speed when the table is resident;
it turns 47.7 GiB of anonymous RAM into 14.2 GiB of VRAM plus 33.5 GiB of pinned RAM. On the 124 GiB test
host that took available RAM from 6 to 19 GiB and removed the swap-in the baseline showed.

That headroom paid for prefill. The host's 3090s run at PCIe 4.0 x8 (AM5 lane split), so every prefill chunk
spends at least 1.55 s streaming a GPU's ~21 GB of cold experts, and the checked-in 2,048-token chunks cap
prefill near 1,300 tok/s there. `configs/fast-256k-prefill.env` is the fast 256K bundle with 8,192-token
chunks, hot76 and `QWEN38_EMBED_UVA=1` (the input embedding in pinned host memory, 1.27 GB of RAM, 0.6 GB of
VRAM per card). Measured 131,072 + 2,048: 3,976 and 4,196 input tok/s (TTFT 33.0 and 31.2 s), 72.0 tok/s
decode after prefill, 71.3 tok/s on 128 + 256; the same host with the checked-in `.env` gave 865 and 67–71.
262,016 + 128 completed with zero preemptions and a 23.6 GiB VRAM peak. Rejected on the same day: hot80 with
8,192-token chunks and 12,288-token chunks with hot72, both `torch.OutOfMemoryError` in the first chunk of the
131K request. The fast bundle at 4,096-token chunks and hot84 gave 2,300 prefill with the best decode (76–81).
Do not use `QWEN38_EMBED_UVA=1` without the PLE table off the host on a 128 GB machine; do not read these x8
numbers as 3090 claims for the x16 benchmark host. Two long runs per configuration: differences under about 5%
are noise.

## Published runtime images

From v0.3.0 on, `.github/workflows/publish-image.yml` builds `docker/Dockerfile`
at each release tag and pushes it to `ghcr.io/dominikbucko/qwen38-flash-next-2x3090`
(tags `vX.Y.Z` and `sha-<commit>`, OCI labels for the revision and base image, and a
build-provenance attestation). Record the resulting digest in the release notes.
These CI images are rebuilt, not the exact local images that produced benchmark
numbers; each benchmark directory keeps its own `environment.json` with the local
image ID. Experimental campaign images remain audit IDs, not pullable images.

## The model is large for a reason

Calling the checkpoint “INT4” is incomplete. The target backbone uses Intel's
AutoRound W4A16 packing, but Qwen3.8-Flash-Next also has a 51.2B-parameter PLE
n-gram table. That table was 102.4 GB in BF16. The release uses the published
RadixArk FP8 E4M3FN table and scale, which cuts it roughly in half without
inventing a new local quantization scheme.

The release payload is therefore expected to remain large:

- target checkpoint: 116.183 GiB, 222,716 tensors in 25 safetensors files;
- compact draft: 3.855 GiB, 4,639 tensors in two safetensors files;
- target backbone: Intel AutoRound W4A16, symmetric INT4 group-128;
- target layers excluded by Intel's quantization policy: original BF16;
- PLE table: published FP8 E4M3FN plus its global scale;
- MTP routed experts: local symmetric INT4 group-32;
- remaining MTP tensors: copied in their source dtype;
- KV cache: BF16.

Do not “fix” the size by quantizing everything to four bits. That would change
the quality contract. In particular, do not requantize Intel's target tensors,
discard the PLE scale, quantize the sensitive BF16 tensors, or change KV dtype
without a quality evaluation that can detect the loss.

## Why vLLM became the target

The early GGUF route was useful for proving that the model could prefill at a
reasonable rate, but it was the wrong place to optimize this architecture. The
hard parts are not a conventional dense INT4 backbone. They are PLE lookup,
hybrid recurrent state, sparse QSA, hundreds of routed experts, and MTP. The
vLLM Qwen3.8 implementation exposed the scheduler, cache lifecycle, MoE backend,
and speculative path needed to work on all of those together.

The final runtime is not stock upstream vLLM. It starts from the digest-pinned
day-zero Qwen3.8 image and installs the exact overlay under
`runtime/vllm-overlay`. `runtime/vllm-overlay/SHA256SUMS.json` prevents a silent
partial overlay. If the base image changes, assume every copied file needs a
three-way review; do not copy the old overlay onto a new vLLM revision and call
it compatible.

## Checkpoint assembly decisions

### Keep Intel packing intact

`scripts/build_intel_fp8ple_hybrid.py` reads the upstream indexes and builds a
new weight map. It does not decode and repack Intel's GPTQ/AutoRound weights.
Unchanged shards are hard-linked by default. The builder:

1. omits Intel shard 16, which contains only the BF16 PLE table;
2. omits Intel's bundled BF16 MTP tensor file;
3. inserts 128 RadixArk FP8 PLE shards plus the published scale tensor;
4. changes `ple_embedding_dtype` to `float8_e4m3fn`;
5. writes `hybrid_sources.json` and a new auditable safetensors index.

Do not infer a broken download from gaps in shard numbering. The index is the
source of truth. `scripts/validate_hybrid.py` checks every indexed tensor against
the actual safetensors headers, rejects duplicates and unindexed tensors, and
verifies that the target has PLE tensors but no bundled MTP tensors.

### Make MTP separate and small

The target does not need its bundled BF16 MTP copy. A standalone draft makes it
possible to compress draft experts aggressively while leaving target decisions
unchanged.

`scripts/build_mtp_int4.py` quantizes only the 512 routed draft experts. It
splits the source gate/up tensor into separate gate and up projections and packs
gate, up, and down weights as symmetric INT4 group-32. Group-32 costs more scale
metadata than group-128 but is a reasonable quality/performance choice for the
small verifier draft.

The development draft uses symlinks to source tensors. That is convenient
locally and wrong for a public model. `scripts/compact_mtp_checkpoint.py`
materializes only tensors selected by the draft index into:

```text
runtime/mtp-int4-g32/mtp-dense.safetensors
runtime/mtp-int4-g32/mtp-routed-experts-int4.safetensors
```

The compact checkpoint has no symlinks. `scripts/validate_compact_mtp.py`
stream-hashes every materialized tensor against the development draft. Preserve
that check if the packing or file layout changes.

### Why FP8 PLE instead of disk or INT4

PLE is an embedding-style lookup over a huge table. Keeping it on disk would put
latency behind page faults and storage locality. It might look acceptable after
the page cache is warm and collapse on an unseen access pattern. The validated
path places it in CPU memory, but the OS can still page it to swap. Check live
residency during serving rather than assuming that configured RAM is sufficient.

FP8 halves the original BF16 table and uses an already published scale. INT4
would save more memory, but it would introduce another unvalidated quality
change in a component that directly injects token-history features. Treat an
INT4 PLE experiment as a new checkpoint, not a runtime optimization.

## Memory placement during serving

The final layout is intentionally asymmetric:

- dense layers, attention work, shared experts, and hot routed experts run on
  the GPUs;
- the complete routed-expert pool remains addressable in pinned system memory;
- an 84-expert-per-layer GPU cache is the full-context default;
- the dynamic LRU changes which experts occupy those slots as the sequence
  evolves;
- the FP8 PLE table belongs to a dedicated CPU process;
- the BF16 KV allocation is 4,429,185,024 bytes, about 4.13 GiB per GPU;
- the compact MTP draft runs beside the target and proposes three tokens.

Cold experts are not dead weights. A token that routes to one still uses it. The
runtime reads it from the host-backed pool or replaces an LRU slot. Offload saves
VRAM; it does not prune the model.

The PLE path is different from copying the whole table to CUDA. The CPU worker
owns the embedding weights, performs the lookup, and publishes the small result
through page-locked shared host buffers. The GPU stream waits on mapped flags,
copies the result, and releases the buffer. The relevant files are:

- `model_executor/layers/ple_offload_layer.py`;
- `v1/ple_offload/worker.py`;
- `v1/ple_offload/connector.py`;
- `models/qwen3_8_flash_next/nvidia/ple_layer.py`.

This is why system-memory latency and bandwidth affect decode even though the
main kernels run on CUDA.

## The serving profile is a coupled system

The checked-in default is `configs/2x3090-128gb.env` plus
`scripts/serve-container.sh`. Important values are:

```text
MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144
MAX_NUM_SEQS=1
MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=4096
MAX_PARALLEL_LOADING_WORKERS=1
KV_CACHE_MEMORY_BYTES=4429185024
CPU_OFFLOAD_GB=30
VLLM_WNA16_STATIC_HOT_CACHE_SIZE=84
VLLM_WNA16_STATIC_HOT_CACHE_MAX_TOKENS=16
VLLM_PREFIX_CACHE_RETENTION_INTERVAL=1600
VLLM_PLE_OFFLOAD_READY_TIMEOUT=1200
MTP_DEPTH=3
VLLM_QSA_EXACT_TOPK=0
DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE=1
```

The measured September 5 candidate overrides were:

```text
VLLM_WNA16_STATIC_HOT_CACHE_SIZE=84
DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE=0
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False
```

The collective and allocator remain experimental overrides; the current default
also uses hot84 for prefill headroom. The PHB host exposed CUDA P2P in both directions. The candidate
completed three exact-count 258,048-input/4,096-output chat streams. Four
recoverable allocator warnings appeared during the first long prefill, with no
stream failures.

`CPU_OFFLOAD_GB=30` is not the total host-memory footprint. The PLE worker owns
its large table separately, and the expert tier has additional storage and
metadata. Likewise, the 16-token hot-cache threshold keeps the LRU fast path on
small decode-shaped batches instead of making a long prefill churn expert slots.

The pinned runtime logs that `max_parallel_loading_workers` is unsupported and
ignored. The retained value of 1 is not a loading-memory bound. Fresh Docker
validation exposed the same warning; do not credit this flag with serializing
rank loads or avoiding host OOM.

Important launch choices:

- TP2 and EP2 split one request across both cards.
- `allgather_reducescatter` is the selected MoE all-to-all backend.
- Humming runs the target W4A16 MoE path.
- Marlin-compatible packing runs the compact INT4 draft experts.
- UVA supplies the host-backed expert tier.
- Chunked prefill uses a 4,096-token scheduling budget.
- Prefix caching uses `--mamba-cache-mode align`.
- CUDA graphs are limited to `FULL_DECODE_ONLY`.
- Async scheduling is disabled.
- Custom all-reduce defaults to disabled because CUDA peer access was unavailable
  on the original validated topology. `DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE=0` exposes an
  experimental custom path. It needs bidirectional CUDA peer access and an
  IPC-compatible allocator: the pinned custom path fails after graph capture
  with `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`. Test the allocator
  override and full model before recommending it. The September 5 candidate
  passed the full-model long probe with expandable segments disabled, but no
  matched same-prompt custom-all-reduce A/B exists. Disabling the custom
  collective does not disable CUDA peer access in the driver or force NCCL to
  use host staging.

Do not tune one of these as if it were independent. Raising the hot-cache size
takes VRAM away from KV and transient prefill buffers. Raising the batched-token
budget changes prefill speed and transient memory. Changing speculative depth
changes draft memory, scheduler lookahead, recurrent-state rollback, and
acceptance. A configuration that wins at 128 tokens may fail at 262K.

## How the hillclimb happened

The matched series used 10 requests per configuration, each with 128 input and
256 output tokens. Its metric is reciprocal mean time per output token. These
are the steps agents should use when reasoning about the final design.

### 1. BF16 target with MTP2: 32.83 tok/s

This established that the model, recurrent state, PLE path, and speculative
plumbing worked. It was not a viable bandwidth profile. Too much target weight
traffic remained in BF16.

### 2. Intel W4A16 group-128: 34.71 tok/s, +1.88

The first quantized run was only a small win because weight format was not the
only bottleneck. Expert placement and dispatch still pulled too much data from
system memory. The important decision was to use Intel's checkpoint as packed,
not to produce another local target quant.

### 3. Keep more experts on CUDA: 41.10 tok/s, +6.39

This was the first clear sign that expert misses dominated decode. More resident
experts saved host reads and transfer synchronization. From this point onward,
expert-cache policy mattered more than another small dense-kernel tweak.

### 4. Pinned H2D plus chunked host cache: 43.68 tok/s, +2.58

Pinned storage removed avoidable staging, and chunk caching reduced the amount
of work repeated for a miss. This was useful but not sufficient: a miss still
sat on the critical token path.

### 5. Static hot-96: 49.81 tok/s, +6.13

A per-layer ranking kept the common experts resident. The layout was stable
enough for CUDA graph capture, so this improved both expert locality and launch
behavior. `configs/static_hot_cache_rankings.json` is an input, not a universal
truth; it reflects measured traffic and can be workload-dependent.

### 6. Mixed VMM hot-128: 57.37 tok/s, +7.56

The mixed allocation created one logical expert tensor with a CUDA-resident hot
prefix and host-backed cold suffix. Kernels kept ordinary contiguous pointer
semantics while physical pages lived in different memory tiers. This removed
extra dispatch paths and allowed Marlin, Triton, and Humming comparisons on the
same placement scheme.

The best short-context capacity was not the full-context default. The historical
release used 88 slots. The current default uses 84 for more prefill headroom;
do not relabel historical results as hot84 measurements.

### 7. Fused QSA: 59.97 tok/s, +2.60

Sparse attention had too much launch and selection overhead at decode batch
sizes. The fused QSA implementation reduced intermediate materialization and
repeated block selection. Its approximate persistent selector is fast because
it does not compute a full exact score ranking every step.

The exact selector remains available with `VLLM_QSA_EXACT_TOPK=1`. It is a
quality experiment, not the default.

### 8. Humming target plus Marlin draft: 65.46 tok/s, +5.49

One backend did not win every shape. Humming was the better target MoE path;
Marlin was the right fit for the packed INT4 MTP draft. Preserve the split when
testing backend changes. “Use backend X everywhere” is not a useful hypothesis.

### 9. Dynamic LRU-100: 78.73 tok/s, +13.27

This was the largest single decode gain. Static popularity is a good initial
state, but expert demand changes within a sequence. The LRU uses the static list
to seed GPU slots, then replaces cold residents with experts actually requested
by current tokens. This attacked the remaining host-miss rate directly.

### 10. Dynamic LRU-104: 80.08 tok/s, +1.35

Four more slots still helped, but returns were flattening and the extra VRAM was
not free. The matched workload finished 2.44 times faster than the BF16/MTP2
baseline.

## Why MTP pushed decode above 100 tok/s

On the warmed 128-input/4,096-output workload:

| Mode | Decode |
|---|---:|
| Target only | 61.32 tok/s |
| Fixed MTP3 | 119.94 tok/s |
| Variable-K scheduler path with MTP3 | 135.21 tok/s |

MTP proposes up to three draft tokens and the target verifies a block. High
acceptance amortizes target invocations over several emitted tokens. Two final
repeat probes measured:

| Decode | Acceptance | Mean accepted length |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 133.976 tok/s | 86.328% | 3.590 |
| 127.102 tok/s | 90.758% | 3.723 |

The accepted-length metric can exceed draft depth three because it includes the
target/verifier token emitted with accepted draft tokens.

The “adaptive MTP3” label needs care. `VLLM_FORCE_DYNAMIC_SPEC_SCHEDULING=1`
selects vLLM's variable-K scheduling machinery, but the checked-in lookup keeps
K fixed at three for the supported batch size. The gain came from that scheduler
path and its padding/placeholder behavior, not from allowing arbitrary draft
depth.

Qwen3.8's hybrid state made speculative decoding more than a command-line flag.
The overlay includes rollback-safe PLE n-gram context, QSA compressor state,
Mamba/GDN state handling, hyperconnection streams, and scheduler lookahead at
chunk boundaries. If speculative output becomes incorrect, inspect state
commit/rollback and placeholder alignment before blaming the draft weights.

MTP changes speed and acceptance, not the target's verification rule. Do not
describe draft INT4 as if the target itself had been requantized to group-32.

## Full-context behavior

The boundary test uses 262,016 input tokens and 128 output tokens, exactly
262,144 total. It measured:

```text
TTFT: 205.409 s
prefill: 1,275.583 prompt tok/s
decode after prompt: 54.485 output tok/s
```

This is a measured 128-output boundary probe, not sustained long-context decode.
It mixes a short generation window with post-prefill state. At 256K, more KV
and sparse-attention state sit on the critical path, but this one short probe
does not isolate those costs. Use a longer output and repeated runs to measure
sustained generation; do not predict it from the 135 tok/s short-prompt figure.

The September 5 candidate directly measured the longer window: three
`repo-chat` requests of 258,048 input + 4,096 output produced 74.030749,
76.707158, and 76.224624 API-observed tok/s, for a 75.636073 reciprocal-mean
aggregate. There was no explicit warmup. TTFT was 215.128, 211.059, and 211.228
seconds. Treat this separately from both the historical 128-output boundary
probe and the historical warmed 128-input/4,096-output result.

A static expert profile reached 1,629 prompt tok/s at the same context boundary,
but it was not the best combined prefill/decode configuration. The released
1,275.6 profile is intentionally balanced. If an experiment reports only a
prefill record, test post-prefill decode before adopting it.

`MAX_NUM_SEQS=1` is deliberate. The allocation targets one real 256K sequence,
not serving concurrency. Increasing concurrency without a new memory plan is a
different product target.

## Prefix caching was an architectural fix

Ordinary KV prefix caching was not enough for this model. Reusing an attention
block while losing or misaligning the hybrid recurrent state gives either a
cache miss or wrong continuation state. The patched runtime aligns cached
boundaries with Mamba blocks and carries QSA/PLE state through the request
lifecycle.

Use `--mamba-cache-mode align`; the model explicitly rejects `all`. When testing
cache changes:

1. send the exact same prefix twice;
2. confirm the second request reports a real cache hit;
3. compare generated tokens against a no-cache run;
4. test a prefix ending off the normal block boundary;
5. include a tool-style multi-turn request, not only a repeated synthetic
   string;
6. measure both latency saved and host/GPU state retained.

Mamba state blocks must be released on the processed-token basis. The base
image frees KV blocks only below the tokens whose steps have completed, because
an in-flight step may still read them. Its align-mode Mamba manager, however,
tracked a single pending state block per request. With async scheduling a step
is always in flight, so each prefill chunk replaced the pending entry before it
could be freed. The generic sweep stops at the first null entry and never
reached the orphan. The result was one leaked block per chunk in each of the
four Mamba groups: a 260K request filled the pool about five times and was
preempted each time. `runtime/vllm-overlay/v1/core/single_type_kv_cache_manager.py`
frees every state block below the latest completed step (September 28: +7.5–8.2%
prefill at 260K, +6% at 131K, zero preemptions; `benchmarks/2026-09-28/`). Watch
`vllm:num_preemptions_total` in any long-context measurement. A single request
should never be preempted.

Under async scheduling a prefill step legitimately holds 3 + num_speculative
state blocks per Mamba group. The completed step, the in-flight step and the new
step each hold one, and the speculative blocks hold the rest. vLLM's static
estimate assumes 2 + num_speculative. A pool sized to exactly 1.00x reported
concurrency therefore needs four more blocks to hold a maximum-length request.

Agent-harness token accounting is not an isolated prefill benchmark. Tool turns,
prefix hits, repeated context, non-streaming time, and generation all mix
together. Use isolated requests for pp/tg claims and the harness only for
end-to-end task behavior.

## QSA precision decision

Approximate QSA is the default because it is faster and the available quality
evidence did not justify the exact cost. The cache-fixed one-trajectory A/B was:

| QSA mode | Strict passes | Hidden-functional passes | Mean score | Workflow passes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Exact | 9/15 | 10/15 | 96.953 | 15/15 |
| Approximate | 7/15 | 11/15 | 97.398 | 14/15 |

This is mixed, noisy evidence. Exact improved strict workflow completion, while
approximate had one more hidden-functional pass and a 0.445 higher mean. One
trajectory per mode is not enough for a quality claim. Run at least three fresh
trajectories per configuration before changing the default.

`tests/test_qsa_exact_topk_cpu.py` verifies the exact selector's visible sets
against `torch.topk` and checks repeatability. That proves a local selection
property, not model-level quality.

## AgentBench notes

The published main run used xhigh reasoning, 32 steps, a 16,384-token response
cap, and one trajectory for each of 15 tasks. It produced 9 strict passes, 11
hidden-functional passes, a 97.601 mean score, 3,841,609 prompt tokens, 196,495
completion tokens, and 313 tool calls. All 15 trajectories ended with a normal
stop.

Long reasoning can still waste budget by revisiting the same hypothesis or
reissuing equivalent tool calls. Do not “solve” that only by shrinking the token
cap; a smaller cap hides the behavior and can cut off legitimate work. When
evaluating a mitigation, retain tool-call and reasoning traces privately and
look for:

- repeated plans with no new evidence;
- the same command or query issued with cosmetic changes;
- failure to update the working hypothesis after a tool result;
- long conclusions that do not change the patch or answer;
- repeated recovery from a tool error without changing the approach.

Harness engineering must not leak into model claims. Keep response parsing,
reasoning preservation, prefix reuse, stop conditions, and endpoint timing
separate in the report. Never publish private tasks, hidden assertions, oracle
code, raw traces, patches, or final workspaces.

## How to run a useful performance experiment

1. Start from the pinned image, checkpoint revision, and released environment.
2. Change one mechanism at a time.
3. Record every environment variable and serving flag.
4. Record the explicit warmup policy and keep it identical in comparisons.
5. Use the 128-input/256-output matched workload for hillclimb comparisons.
6. Use 128-input/4,096-output only for long-decode and MTP studies.
7. Record MTP acceptance and accepted length with decode throughput.
8. Test 262,016 input + 128 output before claiming full-context compatibility.
9. Record TTFT, pp, tg, request completion, and any stream error separately.
10. Re-run enough times to distinguish a real gain from cache warmth and
    sequence-dependent expert routing.
11. Keep the old result. A hillclimb without the losing configurations is not
    useful evidence.

When a change improves short decode, ask whether it consumed VRAM needed by the
full-context cache. When it improves prefill, ask whether post-prefill decode
regressed. When it improves MTP throughput, inspect acceptance. When it changes
QSA, cache state, PLE precision, or target weights, run a quality evaluation.

## Public benchmark client

`scripts/benchmark_serving.py` records new synthetic streaming measurements; it
does not reconstruct the private historical prompt fixtures. `repeated-seed`
uses a short periodic text, while `repo-code` uses sorted public runtime-overlay
Python files and records their hashes and token IDs. `repo-chat` adds a public
tutorial instruction and obtains chat-template wrappers from the server's
full-source and empty-source tokenizations; only the source interior is resized.
At 128 tokens only a small source prefix fits. Inspect captured output: raw
short-code probes showed repetition and must remain diagnostic evidence.
Always name the workload.
A repetitive prompt can favor PLE and expert-cache locality and is not a
representative application or quality benchmark.

The client requires exact server usage, exact streamed output-token counts, a
length finish, and a complete SSE stream. It reports API-observed TTFT and
post-first-chunk decode timing; MTP and SSE buffering mean those are not kernel
latencies. Optional output capture happens after timing stops. Compare repeated
runs using reciprocal mean TPOT; retain per-run timings and output-token hashes.
Unique cache salts isolate prefix-block reuse, not the LRU, PLE pages, graphs,
or other warm state. The embedded lock is expected repository provenance, not
proof of what a remote endpoint loaded; record the actual runtime separately.

Use 258,048 input + 4,096 output to study sustained generation close to the
262,144-token limit. Preserve the original 262,016 + 128 boundary probe as
capacity evidence, and do not label its short output rate as sustained
long-context performance. Keep new workload results separate from the old
hillclimb unless request content and complete test conditions are matched.

The published September 5 bundle is under `benchmarks/2026-09-05/`. Completion
counts include reasoning and control tokens. Forced 4,096-token chat captures
can end during reasoning, so these probes do not establish answer quality. A
separate hot-cache-86 raw `repo-code` diagnostic with custom all-reduce disabled
and expandable segments enabled measured 78.8238 tok/s at 258,048 + 4,096.
Because the prompt and profile differ, it is not promotional evidence or a
controlled custom-all-reduce speed comparison.

## Startup and validation sequence

For the published checkpoint:

```bash
export MODEL_DIR=/models/qwen38-flash-next
make build-image
make preflight
make serve
```

Before publishing source changes:

```bash
make validate
python scripts/check_release_ready.py
for script in scripts/*.sh; do
  bash -n "$script"
done
```

CI can check source syntax, overlay hashes, lock consistency, accidental model
blobs, symlinks, and common token formats. It cannot prove CUDA correctness,
the 256K allocation, PLE worker synchronization, prefix-cache correctness, MTP
acceptance, or throughput. Those require the target hardware.

Before publishing a rebuilt checkpoint, run all three validators:

```text
scripts/validate_hybrid.py
scripts/validate_compact_mtp.py
scripts/validate_upload.py
```

`validate_upload.py` must report zero symlinks and exact agreement between each
index and the safetensors headers.

## Failure modes worth checking first

### Server appears hung during startup

If two-client startup stops halfway through CUDA graph capture, check the PLE
ready flag. Each eager capture warmup consumes that flag. Signalling it only
once before the graph loop lets the next shape wait forever: no real CPU PLE
request was submitted to signal it again. The capture hook in
`v1/worker/gpu/cudagraph_utils.py`, supplied by `gpu/model_runner.py`, re-arms
dummy outputs before every forward in the capture loop. Keep this hook when
updating the pinned runtime. Limiting graph sizes can hide the bug by skipping
target graphs; it is not equivalent to fixing the handshake.

The September 16 test with hot80, two 131,072-token windows, a 4,697,620,480-byte
KV pool per GPU, 2,048-token prefill chunks, and MTP3 passed default graph
capture. Two distinct 129,024-input/2,048-output streams completed with zero
preemptions. The pool reported 263,416 tokens. Both clients were resident at
once, with 97.1% peak KV use. Small sequential/concurrent secret-isolation JSON
checks passed. See `benchmarks/2026-09-16/concurrency.json` for the exact
conditions. The 76.53 tok/s joint long-decode window is one probe, not a new
headline: one client's earlier generation overlaps the other client's prefill,
and near-boundary tail stalls remain visible. Do not add individual whole-
request decode estimates to claim aggregate throughput.

The CPU PLE worker has to load roughly half the checkpoint and register shared
buffers. The ready timeout is 1,200 seconds for a reason. Check worker progress,
resident memory, and actual disk reads before killing it. Do not confuse a long
weight load with a 256K prefill.

### Host starts swapping

Separate configured swap from active paging. A 128 GiB host needs NVMe-backed
swap for load-time headroom; 32 GiB is the minimum recommendation and 48–64 GiB
is safer. Swap remaining allocated after startup is not itself a failure.
Sustained `vmstat` swap-in/swap-out during decode is a performance problem:
PLE and cold expert accesses then wait on storage, so do not compare that run
with the published numbers.

### Decode is much slower than expected

Check, in this order:

1. the INT4 target was loaded with its native AutoRound metadata;
2. Humming is active for target MoE;
3. the hot-cache ranking file was found inside the container;
4. dynamic LRU and mixed VMM are enabled;
5. MTP loaded the compact draft rather than the target or BF16 bundled draft;
6. speculative acceptance is nonzero and close to the recorded range;
7. the request is not a 256K post-prefill decode being compared with 128 input;
8. exact QSA was not enabled accidentally;
9. the host is not swapping;
10. CUDA graph capture did not fall back for decode.

### Full context OOMs while short tests pass

QSA prefill used to allocate up to 128 MiB of scores per row chunk and keep the
previous chunk alive while allocating the next. The issue-5 fix caps scores at
64 MiB and explicitly releases each chunk. At 1,024 rows and 65,536 columns,
the CUDA probe measured 266.02 -> 73.51 MiB peak extra allocation. A 96 MiB
temporary allocator budget reproduces the old OOM and admits the new path.
All seven tested shapes (4 through 4,096 rows) select the same attention-token
sets. Approximate top-k order itself is non-deterministic even in the unchanged
baseline; compare selected sets, not only ordered index arrays. No top-k budget,
visible columns, target weights, or numeric dtype is reduced by this fix.

Full-model checks with both fixes retained MTP3, BF16 KV, 4,096-token prefill,
and 262,144 total context. Hot88 completed the same staircase as the control;
full-context TTFT was 217.59 vs 217.22 seconds, with inference allocation retries
reduced from 20 to 4. Hot84 completed 262,016+128 as its first user request, then
1,024+128 and 128+1,024, with zero inference retries. Both had two recoverable
load-time retries. Keep hot84 as the default instead of reducing the KV pool
or precision. No universal driver/display-memory guarantee follows
from one native host. The short 32/128-output timings have SSE buffering
artifacts and must not become new decode claims.

The matched September 16 long-decode sweep retained the same public repo-chat
input token hashes across hot88, hot86, and hot84. Each profile used a 512-token
smoke, a 4,096-token warmup, three 128+4,096 requests, and one 258,048+4,096
request. Short aggregates were 78.92/76.06/75.81 tok/s; full-context decode was
77.50/77.67/77.59. Inference allocation retries were 2/2/0. See
`benchmarks/2026-09-16/long-decode.json` and `qsa-memory.md` in the same directory.
Do not replace historical headline results or extend their graph with these
unmatched workloads. The long-context rate is a single request per profile.

The September 16 fresh Docker replay built the public Dockerfile from an empty
image cache, mounted only the checkpoint read-only, and used the public launcher.
All 29 installed overlay hashes and 32 GPU-free tests passed in the image;
CUDA peer access and tensor-copy equality passed in both directions. The
two-client profile completed both 129,024+2,048 requests, with 97.1% peak KV use,
zero preemptions, and 81.89 tok/s during overlapping decode. Hot84 defaults
passed 262,016+128 as the first request, then two short checks. Both launches
had two loading retries and zero inference retries. Record first-use JIT and
host paging; do not label these warmed speed or fully RAM-resident measurements.
`benchmarks/2026-09-16/docker-validation.json` contains the image digest,
installed versions, exact settings, and caveats. Historical claims are unchanged.

PLE residency was not complete: the worker retained roughly 35 GiB in swap
after loading, with 29 GiB reported available RAM. Decode-only samples read
about 86–154 MiB per 4,096 output tokens. This is observed paging, not a measured
latency attribution or proof that swap can safely be disabled. Preserve this
caveat when comparing cache sizes and historical MTP peaks.

Verify the explicit KV byte allocation and `MAX_NUM_SEQS=1`. Then inspect hot
cache capacity, batched-token budget, and transient allocations. Do not reduce
`MAX_MODEL_LEN` and still call the result a full-context profile.

### Image inputs are rejected

The original launcher hard-coded `--language-model-only`; the resulting
`At most 0 image(s)` error did not mean the checkpoint lacked vision weights.
The published target contains 333 `model.visual.*` BF16 tensors, 897,862,112
payload bytes, in `model-00015-of-00017.safetensors`. Its AutoRound metadata
explicitly excludes `.*visual.*` from INT4 quantization. Do not fetch a second
vision checkpoint or requantize these tensors to enable images.

The opt-in launcher uses `ENABLE_VISION=1`, one image, no video, a 1,048,576-pixel
processor cap, and `--mm-encoder-tp-mode weights`. Use the hot80 profile in
`configs/vision.env` to leave room for the BF16 GPU tower and encoder working
memory. Text-only defaults remain hot84. This is not a CPU encoder feature:
moving preprocessing to CPU would not move the tower. The existing model class
already instantiates Qwen3_VisionTransformer when language-model-only is false,
and this checkpoint has no deepstack visual injection levels. No runtime
overlay changes or new model files were needed for the tested image path.

The first checks used three neutral prompts asking for printed codes and left/
right colors from synthetic PNGs. Expected answers were present only in pixels,
not in the text prompt. Both 768x512 cases and the 1536x1024 downscaling case
passed. A two-image request returned HTTP 400, and image requests advanced both
MTP draft and accepted-token counters. These are bounded grounding checks, not
a broad vision quality benchmark. With the encoder loaded, all three subsequent
text checks passed: 262,016+128, 1,024+128, and 128+1,024. The shared KV capacity
remained 276,313 tokens, with no inference allocation retries or preemptions.
The full-context check was text-only, after the image probes; it was not a cold
request or a full-context multimodal check. See `docs/vision.md` for setup and
`benchmarks/2026-09-16/vision.json` for evidence and limits.

### Long prompts are slower than their length predicts

Compare `vllm:num_preemptions_total` before and after the request. With
`MAX_NUM_SEQS=1` it should not move. If it does, log the live blocks per KV
cache group at each scheduler step. Before the September 28 fix, the Mamba
groups grew by one block per prefill chunk until the pool filled. Each
preemption resets the computed tokens and re-admits the request from its own
prefix cache, so the output stays correct but the prefill runs slower. Also
check that the KV pool has room for the async-scheduling state blocks (see
"Prefix caching was an architectural fix").

### Prefix caching reports hits but output changes

Suspect hybrid state. Inspect Mamba-aligned splitting, QSA compressor state,
PLE n-gram context, copy-on-write block retention, and speculative rollback.
A KV block hit alone is not sufficient evidence of a correct cache hit.

### MTP works without chunked prefill and fails with it

Inspect scheduler lookahead and placeholder rows at chunk boundaries. Multi-step
MTP reads farther ahead than Eagle-style one-token drafting. The patched
scheduler reserves `num_spec_tokens` of prefill lookahead and drops padding
rather than shortening an invalid speculative tail.

### A shard number appears missing

Read `model.safetensors.index.json`. Validate the mapped filenames and headers.
Do not manufacture or download an unreferenced file merely to make numbering
contiguous.

### Hub upload appears to require another full copy

The assembly uses hard links for unchanged target files; keep source directories
until upload finishes. The public draft must be compacted because Hub uploads
cannot rely on local symlinks. Xet deduplicated the published 121 GB tree against
upstream chunks, so the first release transferred only 2.36 GB over the network.

## Ideas that are still worth testing

These are experiments, not promised wins:

1. Relearn hot-expert rankings from a broader workload, then compare static
   initialization plus LRU against a cold LRU.
2. Sweep cache capacity around the 84-slot full-context default. Measure
   VRAM headroom, miss rate, short decode, and post-256K decode together.
3. Test MTP depth and scheduling with acceptance-aware reporting. More draft
   tokens can lose when verification or rollback cost grows.
4. Repeat exact-versus-approximate QSA with at least three independent
   AgentBench trajectories per mode.
5. Measure prefix-cache hit rate and latency on realistic multi-turn agent
   transcripts rather than repeated synthetic prompts.
6. Run a controlled same-prompt hot-cache-84 comparison with custom all-reduce
   enabled and disabled before attributing a speed change to the collective.
   The current raw baseline used a different prompt and profile.
7. Profile host expert misses and PLE lookup separately. Both touch system
   memory, but they need different fixes.
8. Evaluate any lower-precision KV or PLE variant as a new quality/performance
   point, with the released BF16-KV/FP8-PLE model as the control.

The central lesson is that this result did not come from one fast kernel. It
came from choosing a trustworthy target quant, reducing the one table that
dominated system memory, placing experts according to live demand, making the
hybrid cache lifecycle correct, and then giving MTP a scheduler path where high
acceptance could translate into fewer target steps. Preserve that system view.
